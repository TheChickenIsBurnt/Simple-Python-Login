# Simple Login Feature

made by @TheChickenIsBur on repl.it, aka @TheChickenIsBurnt on github.

This code is a very simple login feature in python. You can change "your username" and
"your password" on lines 14 and 16 to whatever you like, and you can put any type
of code after the succesful login, like documents or games or something.
